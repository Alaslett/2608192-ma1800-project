a) My project focuses on how websites and media can influence our thoughts on a certain topic or individual. This idea is personal to me as I often find myself to be curious about certain stories or content I see online specifically down to thumbnails or interesting captions, I then find myself being underwhelmed by what I find as after research I find the content to be untrue and to of been a waste of my time. The intention behind my website is to create confusion and frustration within the user and for them to reflect on why they have made the decision to follow a specific link or be drawn to a particular image. 
My website features a variety of links in presented through images and text in order to highten the users curiosity whilst using my website and make it easy to navigate. A last minute decision I decided to make was to include back buttons so that the user would be able to easily find different sections of my website. The inetention behind the two fake pages is to waste the viewers time by including moving images over the text that they are required to read in order to understand why they have been navigated towards these webpages. I intended for my idea to be inspired by art from the early 2000s in order to create a nostalgic feel and be inspired by magazines during this time. My reasoning for this aestetic choice was due to reflecting on the covers I saw when I was younger - typically from The Sun and how the graphics they used made me curious to read the magazine or newspaper.
