<p class="text"> Oh dear, it seems that you have chosen the wrong path,<br>
    a path that many choose without realising. The internet forces<br>
    us to form an instant opinion on something we may not know a<br>
    lot about. Not every page you visit will tell you if an article<br>
    is fake I'm afraid but mine does. In order to reward your interest<br>
    I am going to make this page really easy to read and talk about some <br>
    of my favourite things. I guess when this website is done we will see<br>
    whether I have added a bit of Harry Styles into your viewing but if<br>
    I haven't then I guess we can sit together in silence.Well at least<br>
    you get to see a lovely purple background so hopefully that \cheers<br>
    you up- if iv'e added that. I am not lazy I probably just ran out of<br>
    time. I know its a difficult thing to process but we can't all get what<br>
    we want in life. I wanted to finish this webpage, you wanted Harry Styles<br> 
    and a purple background.Life is not fair is it.... unless this page is<br>
    finished and I have added a little spice. Only you will know and I guess<br>
    future me because I will come back to this webpage but as of now I dont.\<br>
    Look I am sorry you ahd to read all of this but this is what happens when we<br>
    make the wrong decisions,if it makes you feel any better I have had to type<br>
    all of this down. My poor fingers ;-;. To be honest you do have free will to<br> 
    leave right now but your curiosity has gotten the better of you, will I reach<br>
    the desired conclusion you want or completely waste your time? I have now added<br>
    this phone in another annoying element of this page, I do sincerely apologise for<br>
    that I dont know what I was thinking. It did make me smile though as I myself, am<br>
    finding this hard to read. I am soo proud of you that you have read this all though!</p></div>
