<p>Well, well ,well, it seems you have been clickbaited at no fault of my own. Look I know I made the website but you would of had to of known that this would happen. I mean what kind of gossip did you think I was going to lay on you? This is just a demonstration of how our curiosity can get the better of us and lead us to click on silly things which influence the ways in which we think about people. Its dangerous because it influences our beliefs and actions towards those who we read a fake article about. Theres real people behind these stories which I think we forget as all of us are beginning to experience conversation behind a screen. Maybe before clicking on something next time, especially with the growth of AI, ask yourself ... does this seem real? I really hope that you can find the real page because it took me soo long to make. I'm counting on you, now go !!</p>
